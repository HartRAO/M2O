<h3>Crimea H2O</h3>
<p>On the 8th of September, 2017, 22 GHz water maser super-bursts were seen in the massive star
forming regions W49N and G25.65+1.05 (hereafter referred to as G25) during two independent
maser monitoring campaigns. The maser sources reached fluxes of >30,000 Jy and >18,000 Jy for
W49N and G25 respectively; both sources rose more than two orders of magnitude on the day of
the super-bursts. Currently, fluxes of W49N and G25 are >2,000 Jy and >13,000 Jy, respectively.
Maser bursts are extremely rare and poorly understood. The Deguchi & Watson (1989) provides
a possible mechanism whereby an exponential increase in amplification is achieved when
the maser path length along the line of sight increases due to a chance alignment of velocity coherent
maser clouds along the line of sight to the observer. This was observed in the Orion KL
super burst in Shimoikura et al. (2005). Such a scenario would only affect the velocity features
involved in the alignment and would not induce any global change in conditions in the region.
Alternatively, maser burst behavior may reflect a sudden change in the number of seed photons
being amplified by the maser - potentially tracing an accretion burst - or a sudden change to more
favorable pumping conditions (enhanced abundance, temperature, collisions) in the local physical
masing gas - driven by localised shocks. Our goal is to study the maser burst phenomenon in G25
and W49N and relate the burst mechanism to star formation activities.</p>
